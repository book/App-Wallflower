Wallflower::Tutorial - Turn your Plack app into a static site

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # do cool stuff using Plack-aware frameworks,
    # to generate static web sites

=head1 WRITING A PSGI APPLICATION FOR WALLFLOWER

The point of saving URL from a PSGI application to files is not simply
to make a static version of a fully dynamic site.

Contrary to a lot of static web site generators, L<wallflower> does
I<not> enforce any conventions on its users.

B<L<wallflower> makes it very easy to write a static website using
the web framework of your choice.>

To make the most of a static website, there are a few simple
rules to follow, listed below:


=head2 All URL should have an extension

A PSGI/Plack is able to define the C<Content-Type> that will be sent
for any URL content.

On the other hand, static file servers use the extension to decide what
C<Content-Type> to send for a given file. When unable to decide what
the file content is, servers usually send C<application/octet-stream>
as the C<Content-Type>.

Since the goal of a L<Wallflower> application is to generate a static
website, it is recommended that I<all URL should have an extensions>.


=head2 Hide the non-static elements in a specific Plack environment

Because the web site can be written with any modern web framework, it's
also very easy to have URL that reply to C<POST> requests. Obviously,
these pages can not be saved on the static destination.

It's very easy to use the Plack environment to decide which pages
to enable. By default, L<plackup> sets the Plack environment to
C<development>, while L<wallflower> sets it to C<deployment>.

It's therefore possible to hide the dynamic parts of the application
in the C<development> environment, while only the static elements are
reachable from the C<deployment> environment.


=head2 Make all URL eventually reachable from the root

By default, L<wallflower> starts by loading C</>, and automatically
and recursively follows all URL found in HTML and CSS document, until
all reachable URL have been processed.

The simplest way to generate the full static site is to make
sure that all URL can be reached by following links from the root.


=head1 URI SEMANTICS COMPARED TO DIRECTORY SEMANTICS

A Plack application deals with URI. Nothing prevents the application
to consider that F</thunk> and F</thunk/> are different, and to return
different content bodies for each of them.

When dealing with a filesystem, however, if F<thunk> is a directory,
then it is semantically equivalent to F<thunk/>. And it is impossible
to have both a file and a directory with the same name inside the same
parent directory.

When dealing with a static site, the server maps the URI to the
filesystem. If F<thunk> is a directory, the server usually redirects the
client to F<thunk/>. Then the default file is picked for the content,
traditionally F<thunk/index.html>.

Because L<Wallflower> does not know the conventions used by the Plack
application it calls, it cannot decide if F</thunk> should be understood
as a "file" or as a "directory" when generating the file name that will
receive the content for that URI.

If your application treats F</thunk> and F</thunk/> as identical, you
should I<always> request F</thunk/> with L<wallflower>, otherwise you
might end up with the F<thunk> file already existing when it tries to
create files under the F<thunk/> directory, or vice-versa.

See also the section L</"All URL should have an extension">, for reasons
to avoid extensionless URL.
