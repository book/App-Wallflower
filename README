App-Wallflower

DESCRIPTION

wallflower is a command-line tool to render a Plack application as
a set of static files.

wallflower is not a "static site generator": it is a tool to write your
own static file generator using any Perl web framework or even a hand-crafted
Plack application.

The best way to use it is to actually design your Plack application to
serve "static" files. Please consult the Wallflower::Tutorial manual page
for tips on how to write your Plack application to work with wallflower.
